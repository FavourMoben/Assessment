WHY I DESIGNED IT LIKE THAT:

THE DIFFICULTIES I FACED:
    I have had abit of experience with html and css so it wasn't very complicated but the difficulty i faced
    was actually doing the research about history and other information.
    I also had faced a little bit of difficulties using bootstrap.
    Any time i tried to use its class name my website's design just changes making thing more uglier
