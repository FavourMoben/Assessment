            <h2>What are the best places to eat in New Orleans?</h2>
            You’ll find oysters, raw, broiled, baked, deep-fried or piled on a po’boy, in almost every corner of New Orleans. The lines are long at Acme Oyster House, the oldest oyster bar in the French Quarter, but it’s a must stop for oyster lovers. Choose a seat at the bar were you can watch your oysters being shucked. If you’d rather have a beer with your oysters, try Crescent City Brewhouse. The restaurant hosts jazz bands most nights and has a full menu if you’re traveling with companions who don’t appreciate oysters.
