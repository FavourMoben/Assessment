The annual festivity often lasts for 2 weeks, with loud music, quirky costumes, and elaborate floats parading through the streets of the city.

            <h2>What are the best places to eat in New Orleans?</h2>
            You’ll find oysters, raw, broiled, baked, deep-fried or piled on a po’boy, in almost every corner of New Orleans. The lines are long at Acme Oyster House, the oldest oyster bar in the French Quarter, but it’s a must stop for oyster lovers. Choose a seat at the bar were you can watch your oysters being shucked. If you’d rather have a beer with your oysters, try Crescent City Brewhouse. The restaurant hosts jazz bands most nights and has a full menu if you’re traveling with companions who don’t appreciate oysters.
            Get more for less by searching out restaurants with happy hour pricing on oysters. Samuel’s Blind Pelican has raw bar oysters for a quarter and charred oysters for $10 a dozen, as well as 50 beers on
