                <h3>SHOPPING</h3>
                <p>Shopping is a very essesential experience important for both families and individuals.
                    My shopping experience in new orleans has been the best with a variety of malls to fantastic
                    markets,large or small depending on the category.I'll recomment this place for shopping 
                    if you went to N.O and had any plans of shopping
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span>The French Market</span>
                            <p> a good spot to stop if youâ€™re looking for a quick bite to eat or even fresh produce for whipping up a meal</p>

                        <li>
                           <span>Canal Place Mall</span>
                            <p>Tax-free shopping is an option for international travellers. Expect the brands you likely already know and possibly love, from Banana Republic and Brooks Brothers to Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co</p>

                <h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
                <p>Navigation in general is a very important regardless of where you are. In New orleans especially if you were just visiting or a tourist i think it is important to know your 
                    way around and how to move from place to place.With Technology now navigation is way easier than before e.g google maps software .Most people in new orleans especially people below the age of 20 
                    don't have means of transport that is cost efficient to go to places like school or work, but in new orleans there is a variaty of train stations and bus stations you can use for transport which is also not too expensive.<br>
