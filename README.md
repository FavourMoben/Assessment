WHY I DESIGNED IT LIKE THAT:

    <!-- https://dribbble.com/ --> 
    I never really had a specific design so i went to the dribble.com and also to codepen.io 
    and found some interesting designs.
    So i merged different components and came out with something.
    
THE DIFFICULTIES I FACED:

    I have had a bit of experience with html and css so it wasn't very complicated but the difficulty i faced
    was actually doing the research about history and other information.
    I also had a little bit of difficulties using bootstrap.
    Any time i tried to use its already predefined class name on my code
    a lot of changes start happening especially with my design
